# Awesome-instruction-tuning

## Dataset

This project will collect all existing open-source instruction tuning datasets to help the community to better fine-tune the language model.Our contribution can be listed as follows:
1. These existing datasets mainly focus on english. Based on open-source translation models, we build a pipline to translate them to other n languages. And we will provide the translated dataset successively. 
2. We release the translation code to benefit the low-resoure languages community. We don't use commercial APIs, so it's free.
3. We rewrote some Chinese datasets to fit the instruction fine-tuning format. 

Type have two options: task and chat. "task" represents that the datasets modified from natural language precessing. "chat" represents that the datasets are collected from  the Internet or generated by Chatgpt.
